        Grapes naturally have all the ingredients needed to become wine. The
        pulp contains sugar, water, and acid. Sugar is converted into alcohol
        during fermentation, while the acid keeps wine crisp and refreshing.
        It's skin contains compounds that provide color, flavor, and tannin. The
        bloom on the skin has bacteria and yeast, the latter of which is
        responsible for turning the sugar into alcohol. While the process for
        making great wine is much more complicated, all that is needed to make
        wine is to puncture or crush the berry for the yeast to get to the
        contents.

      <h3>Grape Variety</h3>
      <p>
        Selecting a grape variety is one of the most important decisions in
        making wine. Location and climate, as well as the ability to sell a
        certain type of wine, will have a big impact on that decision. Each type
        of grape has different qualities that impact it’s ability to grow in an
        area. Certain grapes may have bud break around the same time as spring
        frosts which could cause the vine to produce much less. Some grapes do
        better in warmer climates, or in certain types of soil. For example,
        Pinot Noir is a relatively thin-skinned grape and prefers cooler
        climates. Each grape has unique qualities that affect the wine made from
        it. Cabernet Sauvignon has plenty of acid and due to it's thick skin it
        also has lots of tannin These two traits result in a wine with lots of
        structure and increased aging potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and almost all well know
        grape varieties used in wine belong to the species Vitis Vinifera. Each
        species have different characteristics and qualities that may make them
        suitable to different climates, but none come close to Vitis Vinifera’s
        greatness for making wine. To make the choice even tougher, there are
        well over 5,000 different cultivars of Vitis Vinifera!
      </p>
      <h3>The affect of Phylloxera</h3>
      <p>
        While Vitis Vinifera has long been the number one grape species, it has
        had some major issues at times. During the mid nineteenth century, many
        of the world’s vineyards were devastated by Phylloxera, a root louse.
        Phylloxera originated in the Americas where the local vine species, not
        Vitis Vinifera, developed natural defenses to it. This pest eventually
        found it’s way to European vineyards where it easily killed the vines
        that had not developed any ways to survive against it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A solution was found in the form of grafting. Grafting in wine is when
        you combine the root of one vine with the trunk of another vine. In this
        case, Vitis Vinifera vines were grafted onto the roots of vine species
        that had built up defenses against Phylloxera.
      </p>
      <h3>Choosing a Rootstock</h3>
      <p>
        Grafting is a common practice nowadays and choosing the best rootstock
        is a major decision in the vineyard. Rootstocks have many more qualities
        than just resistance to pests (though pest resistance is still the most
        important quality). Different rootstocks perform well in different
        conditions and soils.
