    explanation:
      "Pressing occurs in red wine at or near the end of fermentation. The pressed juice may be blended immediately with the free-run juice, aged separately for blending later, or bottled on its own. Some wineries may not use press wine at all because it differs from free-run juice in terms of tannins, acidity, and flavor due to its extended contact with skins, seeds, and/or stems.",

      },
    ],
    explanation:
      "Most red and some white wines will also go through a second process called malolactic fermentation (MLF or malo), either during or after the primary fermentation. Caused by a lactic acid bacteria, malolactic fermentation converts the tart, natural malic acid in grapes (present in green apples) to a softer, rounder lactic acid (present in dairy). This can happen naturally but is often initiated through the inoculation of bacteria. The amount of conversion of malic to lactic acid can be anywhere from 1 to 100 percent. In white wines, malolactic fermentation is most common in Chardonnay, but the process can be used with any grape. Its effect, noted in mouthfeel, texture, and weight, ranges from subtle to dramatic, depending on how the technique is employed.",

      "France and the United States are key sources for oak barrels, but barrels also come from Hungary, Slovenia, and other European countries. France and the US rely on different oak species and production techniques, and the resulting barrels can impart distinct aromas.

    explanation:
      "Sulfur dioxide is added at various points during the winemaking process, most often during fermentation and maturation, and before bottling. Sulfur has the preservative qualities needed to protect wine from oxygen. But too much SO2 may result in excess hydrogen sulfide, which leads to a rotten egg aroma. This can be so intense in a young wine that decanting is warranted. Avoiding sulfur usage entirely, however, which is common among natural wine proponents, can lead to premature spoilage.",
