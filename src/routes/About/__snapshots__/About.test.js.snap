      Quaff Quizz is an interactive wine learning experience. Learn new material in bite sized chunks and later study the topics already encountered to solidify knowledge. These concepts, 
      <em>
        Learn
      </em>
       
      and 
      <em>
        Study
      </em>
      , are the pillars of Quaff Quizz. The Home page displays the next avialable module through 
      <em>
        Learn
      </em>
       as well as the three topics from 
      <em>
        Study
      </em>
       that require the most attention.

      Locked modules are greyed out to clearly mark which modules are available to take at any time. Modules that have been taken display the best score, while the next available module that has not been taken or passed displays “next”. Achieving a score of 75% or greater on the “next” module unlocks the following module.

      <em>
