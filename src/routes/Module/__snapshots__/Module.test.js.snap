      Sunlight into Wine

      The grape naturally has all the ingredients needed for wine. The pulp (juice) contains sugar, water, and acid. The sugar is converted into alcohol during the fermentation process to create alcohol, while acid gives it the zip needed to keep it refreshing. The skin contains compounds that create color, flavor, and tannin. The bloom on the skin has bacteria and yeast, the later of which is responsible for turning the sugar into alcohol. While the process for making great wine is much more complicated, all that is needed to make wine is to puncture or crush the berry for the yeast to get to the contents.

      Selecting a grape variety is one of the important decisions for a vineyard. Location and climate as well as ability to sell a certain type of wine will have a big impact on that decision. Each type of grape has different qualities that impact its ability to grow in an area. Certain grapes may have bud break around the same time as spring frosts which could cause the vine to produce much less. Some grapes do better in warmer climates, or in certain types of soil.
